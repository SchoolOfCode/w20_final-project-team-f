## Project management and understanding the problem

We have used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/upYLypOD/team-f-final-project) and **Jira** to keep track of what everyone is doing. We have also outline a [Project timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzCqbwaTbaTGuGkP9K4_n0n45luToIkwK0QMOIoKTI4/edit#gid=0) to manage our coding sprints and progress. All screenshots and ideas were saved and recorded in a shared _Google drive_.

We also has stand-ups every morning where we would outline the plan for the day and any issues that we had during the previous day.
