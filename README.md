## Project Management and Understanding the Problem

We have used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/upYLypOD/team-f-final-project) and **Jira** to define and keep track of epics and team progress. We have also outlined a [Project timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzCqbwaTbaTGuGkP9K4_n0n45luToIkwK0QMOIoKTI4/edit#gid=0) to manage our coding sprints, expectations and progress. All screenshots and ideas were saved and recorded in a shared _Google drive_.

We also had stand-ups every morning where we would outline the plans for the day and any issues that team members encountered during the previous day.
